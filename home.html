          <h2>Work</h2>
          <p>
            I lead Product Design at <a href="https://web.sycle.net/" target="_blank">Sycle</a>, a software platform for managing audiology practices.
          </p>
          <p>
             I manage a team of two rockstar user experience designers who's optimism and enthusiasm drive me to be a better leader.  I am always asking for their input, trust their judgement and appreciate their dedication to improving the team and themselves immensely.  
          </p> 
          <p>
             Previously, I lead the User Experience at Bitly. Prior to that I spent over 12 years as a freelance designer, with clients ranging from well known brands to early stage startups. I spend a few years working for Dell honing my front-end development skills and learning about Information Architecture. In the late 90's I was busy designing recruiting brochures for many of NYC's top law firms .

          <h2>When I'm not working</h2>
          <p>Most recently I conquered breast cancer, while parenting a toddler during Covid. I'm a dedicated CrossFit athlete currently crusshing it in my garage gym in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/KSMSLyFitASXkxLs9" target="_blank">Fort Langley, BC</a>. I enjoy a quality craft brew, perfecting my latte art, bingeing on Netflix reality shows, and creating garbage trucks out of cardboard boxes.</p>

          <h2>My design principles</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Always put the user first.</li>
            <li>Think in systems.</li>
            <li>User delight is underrated.</li>
            <li>Think big, start small.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>My leadership philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            I believe empathy, trust, and transparency are the foundation upon which great teams are built. As a manager, I care deeply about the experience and success of my team. I strive to create an environment that fosters personal and professional growth by preaching what I practice, listening more, and continuously self-assessing.
